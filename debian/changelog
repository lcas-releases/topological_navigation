  * Merge pull request #48 <https://github.com/LCAS/topological_navigation/issues/48> from Jailander/new-pkg-version
    Making package version number compatible with other packages for release
  * Making package version number compatible with other packages for release
  * Merge pull request #43 <https://github.com/LCAS/topological_navigation/issues/43> from francescodelduchetto/master
    Topological localization package
  * Update README.md
  * Re-initialize particles when the weighting from pose is too little wrt particles; allow small chance of jumping to unconnected nodes
  * get current time when receiving message instead of message time to avoid problems when time received is not accurate enough
  * current_node is now estimated_node, because it's more clear wrt what it contains
  * implemented services for sending observations and getting localisation result back
  * handle with warning when observation is completely disjoint from prediction
  * renaming to bayesian_topological_localisation
  * Contributors: Jaime Pulido Fentanes, francescodelduchetto, jailander
